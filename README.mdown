# Animated Paths for iPad

Animating the drawing of a `CGPath` with the help of `CAShapeLayer.strokeEnd`.

This is a demo project for my blog post at [http://oleb.net/blog/2010/12/animating-drawing-of-cgpath-with-cashapelayer/](http://oleb.net/blog/2010/12/animating-drawing-of-cgpath-with-cashapelayer/).

Robin Chao wrote [a Swift version](https://github.com/RobinChao/AnimatedPaths) of this.
